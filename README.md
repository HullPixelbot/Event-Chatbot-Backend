# Event-Chatbot-Backend
Azure chatbot for control of HullPixelbots during an event.

You can use this to host an event at which poarticipants can take control of HullPixelbot robots and drive them around directly, or create a simple sequence of actions that can be replayed.

The event is managed by the use of an Azure chatbot for the users to interact with and connects to the robots via Azure IoT Hub, sending messages to control the robots using MQTT.
